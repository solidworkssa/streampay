# 21-streampay - Base Native Architecture

> **Built for the Base Superchain & Stacks Bitcoin L2**

This project is architected to be **Base-native**: prioritizing onchain identity, low-latency interactions, and indexer-friendly data structures.

## 🔵 Base Native Features
- **Smart Account Ready**: Compatible with ERC-4337 patterns.
- **Identity Integrated**: Designed to resolve Basenames and store social metadata.
- **Gas Optimized**: Uses custom errors and batched call patterns for L2 efficiency.
- **Indexer Friendly**: Emits rich, indexed events for Subgraph data availability.

## 🟠 Stacks Integration
- **Bitcoin Security**: Leverages Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) via Clarity contracts.
- **Post-Condition Security**: Strict asset movement checks.
